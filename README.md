# Technologies
It's important to mention that due to it's my course project, some technologies had to be replaced in accordance with teacher's requirements (to practice with new technologies for me)

**Base technologies** (which haven't changed during project's development): 
- Kotlin
- MVVM + Clean Architecture
- Retrofit + OkHttp + GSON
- Jetpack Navigation
- Google Play Services Location API
- Unit-testing (JUnit4 + MockK)

**Other technologies** (which have changed during project's development): 
- LiveData (but then it was replaced with Kotlin Flows)
- Dagger 2 (but then it was replaced with Dagger Hilt)
- Kotlin Coroutines (but then it was replaced with RxJava3)
